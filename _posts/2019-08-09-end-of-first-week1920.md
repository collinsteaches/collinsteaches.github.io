*Day 4:*

Today, we will be continuing to work on our slideshows.  They should be finished before Monday and we will all be learning together how to turn in documents.

This is important to learn and understand as we will be working with Microsoft applications and not relying on Google Apps and the well used cloud that you are used to storing and working on documents.
