Today we begin the WBL/YAP program for the SY19-20 School year.

We will be meeting during the class periods until we have solidified a meeting schedule for the year and put a wrap on paperwork.

Some of you will need to begin putting together resumes and other documents for employment and other opportunities.

Join the Remind with the directions [here](/assets/docs/sy1920/wbl/wblinvitetoremind.pdf).
