# Day 12:

### IDT:

As yesterday, we looked at [EverFi](https://platform.everfi.net) and the new Ignition class that they have put out for living in a digital world.  It takes a more in depth look at the community that has been formed outside the traditional communities our parents grew up in.

We will continue on and strive to earn a certificate in EverFi.

This will help us transition into Emerging Technologies in the future and discuss what is out there that is new and frontline in technology as well as exploring what is to come.

### IBT:

We are discussing which wireless device best suits us as individuals.  As we finish the wireless communication lesson, we will be using the terminology therein to describe more about technology and use it more often.
